## Binary logits:

# Employing a sample of 1643 men between the ages of 20 and 24 from the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
# Powers and Xie (2000) investigate the relationship between high-school graduation and parents' education, race, family income, 
# number of siblings, family structure, and a test of academic ability. 

#The dataset contains the following variables:
# hsgrad Whether: the respondent was graduated from high school by 1985 (Yes or No)
# nonwhite: Whether the respondent is black or Hispanic (Yes or No)
# mhs: Whether the respondent’s mother is a high-school graduate (Yes or No)
# fhs: Whether the respondent’s father is a high-school graduate (Yes or No)
# income: Family income in 1979 (in $1000s) adjusted for family size
# asvab: Standardized score on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test 
# nsibs: Number of siblings
# intact: Whether the respondent lived with both biological parents at age 14 (Yes or No)

graduation <- read.table("http://statmath.wu.ac.at/courses/StatsWithR/Powers.txt")

# (a) Perform a logistic regression of hsgrad on the other variables in the data set.
# Compute a likelihood-ratio test of the omnibus null hypothesis that none of the explanatory variables influences high-school graduation. 
# Then construct 95-percent confidence intervals for the coefficients of the seven explanatory variables. 
# What conclusions can you draw from these results? Finally, offer two brief, but concrete, interpretations of each of the estimated coefficients of income and intact.

# (b) The logistic regression in the previous problem assumes that the partial relationship between the log-odds of high-school graduation and number of siblings is linear. 
# Test for nonlinearity by fitting a model that treats nsibs as a factor, performing an appropriate likelihood-ratio test. 
# In the course of working this problem, you should discover an issue in the data. 
# Deal with the issue in a reasonable manner. 
# Does the result of the test change?
