## Poisson

# Data: Research Productivity of Doctoral Students in Bio-chemistry (Long 1990) 
# Productivity of doctoral students in biochemistry during the last three yearsof their PhD programmes. 
# The response variables the number of articles published during this period (art)
# Explanatory variables include:
# - gender of the student (fem=1 for women, 0=men)
# - student’s marital status (mar= 1 if married, 0 otherwise)
# - student’s number of children five years old or younger (kid5); 
# - a rating of the prestige of the student’sPhD department (phd); 
# - number of articles published by the student’s mentor during the three-yearperiod (ment)

# (a) Examine the distribution of the response variable. 
# Does least-squares linear regression appear a promising strategy for these data?

# (b) Perform a Poisson regression of number of articles published on the explanatory variables. 
# What conclusions would you draw from this analysis?

# (c) Consider the possibility of over-dispersion, either by fitting an over-dispersed Poisson model. 
# Is there evidence for over-dispersion? How, if at all, do the results change when over-dispersion is taken into account
