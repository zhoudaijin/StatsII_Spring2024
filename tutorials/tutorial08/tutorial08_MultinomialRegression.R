## Ordered multinomial logits:
  
  # This data set is analyzed by Long (1997).  The response variable has four ordered categories:
  # Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, and Strongly Agree in relation to the statement
  

# "A working mother can establish just as warm and secure a relationship with her children as a mother who does not work."



# The explanatory variables are:

# the year of the survey (1977 or 1989),

# the gender of the respondent,

# the race of the respondent (white or non-white),

# the respondent's age, and

# the prestige of the respondent's occupation (a quantitative variable)

# (a) Perform an ordered (proportional odds) logistic regression of attitude toward working mothers on the other variables.

# What conclusions do you draw?



# (b) Assess whether the proportional-odds assumption appears to hold for this regression.

# Fit a multinomial logit model to the data, and compare and contrast the results with those from the proportional odds model.



# (c) Consider that possibility that gender interacts with the other explanatory variables in influencing the response variable.

# What do you find?
