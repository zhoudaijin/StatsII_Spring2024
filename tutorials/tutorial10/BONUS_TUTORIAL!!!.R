#### Tobit Regression: regression models for censored and truncated data

# Long (1997) provides a dataset of factors affecting a scientist's first academic job. The 
# outcome variable, `job`, is the prestige of the first job, rated 1 to 5 (higher is more 
# distinguished). Other variables include:
# - `fem`: 1 if female, 0 if male
# - `phd`: prestige of PhD department
# - `ment`: citations received by mentor
# - `fel`: 1 if fellowship held, otherwise 0
# - `art`: number of articles published
# - `cit`: number of citations received

# a) Explore the distribution of `job`. What conclusions do you draw regarding the original 
# coding of the `job` variable? what effects could this have on the possible use of this 
# variable as an outcome in a regression model? Run an OLS model with `jobs` as the dependent 
# variable. Comment on the results.

# b) The `jobcen` variable is a recoding of `job` such that values equal to or less than 1
# are scored 1. Run an OLS model using this *censored* variable as the outcome. How do the 
# results differ from the previous model? 

# c) Drop all observations from the dataset where `jobcen` is less than or equal to 1. Run an
# OLS model on this *truncated* dataset. How do the results differ from the previous models?

# d) Finally, using `job` as the dependent variable, run a tobit regression using the vglm()
# function from the VGAM package. You will need to set the arguments correctly, so read the
# help file for this function. Comment on the results.
