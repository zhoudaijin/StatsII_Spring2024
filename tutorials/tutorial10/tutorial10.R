#### Survival Analysis

# The `child` dataset from the `eha` package is a dataset of 26,855 children born in 
# Skellefte?, Sweden, 1850-1884. Children are followed for fifteen years or until death or 
# outmigration.
# The response variable is `exit`
# Explanatory variables include:
# - id: An identification number.
# - m.id: Mother's id.
# - sex: Sex.
# - socBranch: Working branch of family (father).
# - birthdate: Birthdate.
# - enter: Start age of follow-up, always zero.
# - exit: Age of departure, either by death or emigration.
# - event: Type of departure, death = 1, right censoring = 0.
# - illeg: Born out of marriage ("illegitimate")?
# - m.age: Mother's age.

## a) Using the Surv() function, build a survival object out of the `child` data.frame. 
##    Using survfit() and R's plotting functions, produce a Kaplan-Meier plot of the data,
##    firstly for overall survival, and secondly comparing categories of socBranch. How do
##    you interpret the second plot?

## b) Run a Cox Proportional Hazard regression on the data, using an additive model with 
##    `socBranch` and `sex` as explanatory variables. Run a test to assess the quality of the
##    model. How can we interpret the coefficients? Plot the model.
